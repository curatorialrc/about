# About the Curatorial Research Centre

Established in 2018, the CRC is run by Dr Tehmina Goskar and Tom Goskar FSA. It is based in the UK, and works with all aspects of curatorial practice.

We will be experimenting using GitHub to distrubute source materials from some of our digital projects, initially consisting of 3D photogrammetry data.
